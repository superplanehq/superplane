## Overview

Superplane creates a control layer above your existing DevOps tools, letting you orchestrate workflows across multiple platforms from one place. Instead of writing custom scripts and managing workflows separately in each tool, you build visual workflows that coordinate everything automatically.

---

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Integration** - Connect GitHub, Semaphore, CI/CD platforms, and custom webhooks in unified workflows
- **Event-Driven Automation** - Respond to pushes, deployments, alerts, and custom triggers automatically
- **Visual Workflow Builder** - See your entire DevOps process at a glance with real-time status updates
- **Enterprise Security** - Encrypted secrets, role-based access, complete audit trails
- **Centralized Monitoring** - Single dashboard for all your DevOps activities across tools
- **Flexible Deployment** - Cloud-hosted, self-hosted, or local development options
