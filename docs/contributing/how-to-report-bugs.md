# How to Report Bugs

Found something that doesn't work as expected? We'd love to hear about it! Even a brief description helps us improve SuperPlane.

## Quick Start

Just describe what happened and what you expected. That's enough to get started! We can always ask for more details if needed.

## What Helps (But Not Required)

The more information you can share, the easier it is for us to fix the issue. Here's what's helpful:

- **What happened** - A brief description of the issue
- **What you expected** - What you thought should happen instead
- **Steps to reproduce** - If you remember what you did, that's great!
- **Screenshots** - If you can capture it, that's helpful but not necessary
- **Error messages** - If you see any error messages, include them
- **Environment** - Your OS, browser, or SuperPlane version (if you know it)

## Example

Here's a simple example - yours can be even shorter:

```markdown
When I try to save my canvas, I get an error message saying "invalid connection".

I was trying to connect a GitHub trigger to an HTTP action, and when I clicked save,
it failed. I expected it to save successfully.

Error message: "Error: invalid node connection"
```

That's it! We'll ask for more details if we need them.

## Tips

- **Don't worry about perfection** - Any information is better than none
- **It's okay if you can't reproduce it** - Intermittent bugs are still valuable to report
- **Not sure if it's a bug?** - Report it anyway! We'd rather know about it
- **Already reported?** - That's fine too - it helps us know how common the issue is

## After Reporting

We'll take a look and may ask follow-up questions. If you can help with testing a fix, that's great, but there's no pressure!
