# Issue Tracking and Reporting

Thanks for helping make SuperPlane better! This guide explains how we track issues and organize our work.

## Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? We'd love to hear about it! Report it on
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/superplanehq/superplane/issues).

To help us fix it quickly, please include:

- A clear description and steps to reproduce
- What you expected vs what actually happened
- Your environment details (OS, browser, SuperPlane version, etc.)

Don't worry about labels. The core team is triaging and categorizing issues periodically.

## The SuperPlane Board

The **SuperPlane Board** is where we track issues and development work.
