# Using AI Agents for Development

SuperPlane development is AI native. The repository is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants like
Cursor, Codex, or Claude.

This isn't just about using AI to write code faster. It's about building differently. When you pair a great AI
assistant with a codebase that's designed for it, something interesting happens: you can build features that would
have taken days in hours, and ideas that seemed too ambitious suddenly become feasible. The best developers we know
aren't just writing code, they're orchestrating AI agents to build entire systems. That's what we're optimizing
for here. Don't just use AI to do the same work faster. Use it to do work you couldn't do before.

## AGENTS.md Files

The repository includes `AGENTS.md` files that contain guidelines, coding standards, and project structure
information for AI agents:

- **[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)** - Repository guidelines for backend/GoLang work
- **[web_src/AGENTS.md](../../web_src/AGENTS.md)** - Frontend-specific guidelines for TypeScript/React work

These files are automatically loaded in Cursor as workspace rules. For other tools, you can provide them as
context to your AI agent.

We encourage you to use these files with your AI agents and contribute improvements to them. The goal is to
encode good taste into these files, the patterns, principles, and preferences that make code and product feel right.

## Rule of Thumb

If you wrote something manually, think about how we could extend and improve the project to automate this
knowledge for the next time.
