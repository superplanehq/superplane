Trigger and monitor Jenkins builds

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Trigger Build

The Trigger Build component triggers a Jenkins job and waits for it to complete.

### Use Cases

- **CI/CD orchestration**: Trigger builds and deployments from SuperPlane workflows
- **Pipeline automation**: Run Jenkins jobs as part of workflow automation
- **Multi-stage deployments**: Coordinate complex deployment pipelines

### How It Works

1. Triggers the specified Jenkins job with optional parameters
2. Waits for the build to complete (monitored via polling)
3. Routes execution based on build result:
   - **Passed channel**: Build completed with SUCCESS
   - **Failed channel**: Build failed, was unstable, or was aborted

### Configuration

- **Job**: Select the Jenkins job to trigger
- **Parameters**: Optional build parameters as key-value pairs (supports expressions)

### Output Channels

- **Passed**: Emitted when build completes with SUCCESS
- **Failed**: Emitted when build fails, is unstable, or is aborted

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "build": {
      "duration": 120000,
      "number": 42,
      "result": "SUCCESS",
      "url": "https://jenkins.example.com/job/my-project/job/my-job/42/"
    },
    "job": {
      "name": "my-project/my-job",
      "url": "https://jenkins.example.com/job/my-project/job/my-job/"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-23T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "jenkins.build.finished"
}
```
