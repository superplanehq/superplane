## On Event

The On Event trigger starts a workflow execution when Rootly incident timeline events are created or updated.

### Use Cases

- **Incident notes**: Notify Slack or other systems when a note is added
- **Timeline sync**: Mirror timeline events into external systems
- **Investigation automation**: React to annotations as they are added or edited

### Configuration

- **Incident Status** (optional): Filter by incident status
- **Severity** (optional): Filter by incident severity
- **Service** (optional): Filter by service name
- **Team** (optional): Filter by team name
- **Visibility** (optional): Filter by visibility (internal/external)

### Event Data

Each event includes:
- **id**: Timeline event ID
- **event**: Event text
- **kind**: Event kind
- **occurred_at**: When the event occurred
- **created_at**: When the event was created
- **user_display_name**: Display name of the event author (if available)
- **incident**: Incident data from Rootly

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

## On Incident

The On Incident trigger starts a workflow execution when Rootly incident events occur.

### Use Cases

- **Incident automation**: Automate responses to incident events
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when incidents are created or resolved
- **Integration workflows**: Sync incidents with external systems

### Event Data

Each incident event includes:
- **event**: Event type (incident.created, incident.updated, etc.)
- **incident**: Complete incident information including title, summary, severity, status

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
