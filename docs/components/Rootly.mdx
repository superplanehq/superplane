## On Event

The On Event trigger starts a workflow execution when Rootly incident timeline events occur. This is useful for reacting to notes, annotations, and other activities added to an incident's timeline.

### Use Cases

- **Investigation tracking**: Run a workflow when someone adds an investigation note to an incident
- **Status sync**: Forward timeline events to Slack, Jira, or other external systems
- **Automation on notes**: Trigger automations when notes matching certain criteria are posted
- **Audit trail**: Capture timeline events for compliance or auditing purposes

### Configuration

- **Events**: Select which timeline event types to listen for (created, updated)
- **Incident Status** (optional): Only trigger for events on incidents with a specific status (e.g. started, mitigated, resolved)
- **Severity** (optional): Only trigger for events on incidents with a specific severity (e.g. sev0, sev1)
- **Visibility** (optional): Only trigger for events with a specific visibility (internal, external)

### Event Data

Each timeline event includes:
- **event**: The note or annotation text
- **kind**: The type of timeline event (e.g. note, status_update)
- **visibility**: Whether the event is internal or external
- **user_display_name**: The name of the user who created the event
- **incident**: The parent incident details (id, title, status, severity)

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "incident_event.created",
    "incident": {
      "id": "abc123-def456",
