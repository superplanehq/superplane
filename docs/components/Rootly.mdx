## On Incident Created

The On Incident Created trigger starts a workflow execution when a Rootly incident is created.

### Use Cases

- **Incident automation**: Automate responses when new incidents are created
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when incidents are created
- **Integration workflows**: Sync new incidents with external systems

### Configuration

- **Severity Filter** (optional): Only trigger for incidents with specific severity
- **Service Filter** (optional): Only trigger for incidents attached to specific Rootly services
- **Team Filter** (optional): Only trigger for incidents attached to specific Rootly teams

### Event Data

Each incident created event includes:
- **event**: incident.created
- **incident**: Complete incident information including title, summary, severity, status

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "incident.created",
    "incident": {
      "id": "abc123-def456",
      "mitigated_at": null,
      "resolved_at": null,
      "severity": "sev2",
      "started_at": "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z",
      "status": "started",
      "summary": "The API response times have increased significantly across all endpoints.",
      "title": "API latency spike detected",
      "url": "https://app.rootly.com/incidents/abc123-def456"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "rootly.onIncidentCreated"
}
```

## On Incident Resolved

The On Incident Resolved trigger starts a workflow execution when a Rootly incident is resolved.

### Use Cases

- **Close tickets**: Close linked Jira/ServiceNow tickets when the Rootly incident is resolved
- **Status updates**: Post to a status page or Slack when resolution is recorded
- **Post-incident steps**: Trigger retros, follow-ups, or action item syncs

### Configuration

- **Severity Filter** (optional): Only trigger for incidents with specific severity
- **Service Filter** (optional): Only trigger for incidents attached to specific Rootly services
- **Team Filter** (optional): Only trigger for incidents attached to specific Rootly teams

### Event Data

The emitted payload includes the resolved incident data. At minimum, it includes:
- **event**: `incident.resolved`
- **incident**: A map containing fields like id, sequential_id, title, slug, status, resolution_message, resolved_at, resolved_by, url

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "incident.resolved",
    "event_id": "evt-123",
    "incident": {
      "id": "abc123-def456",
      "resolution_message": "The issue was caused by a bad deploy; rollback restored normal latency.",
      "resolved_at": "2026-01-19T12:44:30Z",
      "resolved_by": {
        "id": "usr-123",
        "name": "Jane Doe"
      },
      "sequential_id": 42,
      "slug": "api-latency-spike-detected",
      "status": "resolved",
      "title": "API latency spike detected",
      "url": "https://app.rootly.com/incidents/abc123-def456"
    },
    "issued_at": "2026-01-19T12:45:00Z"
