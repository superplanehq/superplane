## On Incident

The On Incident trigger starts a workflow execution when Rootly incident events occur.

### Use Cases

- **Incident automation**: Automate responses to incident events
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when incidents are created or resolved
- **Integration workflows**: Sync incidents with external systems
- **Post-incident actions**: Trigger follow-up workflows when incidents are mitigated or resolved

### Configuration

- **Events**: Select which incident events to listen for (created, updated, mitigated, resolved, cancelled, deleted)

### Event Data

Each incident event includes:
- **event**: Event type (incident.created, incident.updated, etc.)
- **incident**: Complete incident information including title, summary, severity, status

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "incident.created",
    "incident": {
      "id": "abc123-def456",
      "mitigated_at": null,
      "resolved_at": null,
      "severity": "sev2",
      "started_at": "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z",
      "status": "started",
      "summary": "The API response times have increased significantly across all endpoints.",
      "title": "API latency spike detected",
      "url": "https://app.rootly.com/incidents/abc123-def456"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "rootly.onIncident"
}
```

- **Timeline sync**: Sync timeline events to Slack or external systems
- **Investigation automation**: Run automation when investigation notes are added
- **Audit trail**: Track and forward incident annotations to external systems

### Configuration

- **Events**: Select which timeline event types to listen for (created, updated)
- **Incident status** (optional): Filter by incident status (e.g. started, resolved)
- **Severity** (optional): Filter by incident severity (sev0, sev1, sev2, sev3)
- **Service** (optional): Filter by service name
- **Team** (optional): Filter by team name
- **Event source** (optional): Filter by event source (web, slack, api, email, system)
- **Visibility** (optional): Filter by visibility (internal, external)
- **Event kind** (optional): Filter by event kind (note, status_update, severity_update, assignment, action_item, postmortem, alert, page, slack_message)

### Event Data

Each timeline event includes:
- **id**: Event ID
- **event**: Event type (incident_event.created, incident_event.updated)
- **kind**: Event kind (e.g. note, annotation)
- **occurred_at**: When the event occurred
- **created_at**: When the event was created
- **user_display_name**: Display name of the user who created the event
- **body**: Content of the event (for notes)
- **source**: Source of the event
- **visibility**: Visibility setting
- **incident**: Associated incident information

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.
