## On Incident

The On Incident trigger starts a workflow execution when Rootly incident events occur.

### Use Cases

- **Incident automation**: Automate responses to incident events
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when incidents are created or resolved
- **Integration workflows**: Sync incidents with external systems
- **Post-incident actions**: Trigger follow-up workflows when incidents are mitigated or resolved

### Configuration

- **Events**: Select which incident events to listen for (created, updated, mitigated, resolved, cancelled, deleted)

### Event Data

Each incident event includes:
- **event**: Event type (incident.created, incident.updated, etc.)
- **incident**: Complete incident information including title, summary, severity, status

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "incident.created",
    "incident": {
      "id": "abc123-def456",
      "mitigated_at": null,
      "resolved_at": null,

    }
  },
