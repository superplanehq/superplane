## On Event

The On Event trigger starts a workflow execution when an incident timeline event is created or updated in Rootly.

### Use Cases

- **Note tracking**: Run a workflow when someone adds a note to an incident (e.g. notify channel, update Jira)
- **Timeline sync**: Sync timeline events to Slack or external systems
- **Investigation automation**: Run automation when investigation notes are added

### Configuration

- **Events**: Select which incident events to listen for (created, updated, mitigated, resolved, cancelled, deleted)
- **Incident status**: Filter by incident status (e.g. started, mitigated, resolved)
- **Severity**: Filter by incident severity
- **Service**: Filter by service name
- **Team**: Filter by team name
- **Event source**: Filter by event source (e.g. web, api, slack)
- **Visibility**: Filter by event visibility (internal or external)
- **Event kind**: Filter by event kind (e.g. event, trail)

### Event Data

Each event includes:
- **event**: Event type (incident.created, incident.updated, etc.)
- **event_id**: Unique event identifier
- **issued_at**: Timestamp of the event
- **incident**: Complete incident information including timeline events

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "incident.updated",
    "event_id": "evt-abc123",
    "incident": {
      "events": [
