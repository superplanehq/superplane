## On Incident

The On Incident trigger starts a workflow execution when Rootly incident events occur.

### Use Cases

- **Incident automation**: Automate responses to incident events
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when incidents are created or resolved
- **Integration workflows**: Sync incidents with external systems
- **Post-incident actions**: Trigger follow-up workflows when incidents are mitigated or resolved

### Configuration

- **Events**: Select which incident events to listen for (created, updated, mitigated, resolved, cancelled, deleted)

### Event Data

Each incident event includes:
- **event**: Event type (incident.created, incident.updated, etc.)
- **incident**: Complete incident information including title, summary, severity, status

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "incident.created",
    "incident": {
      "id": "abc123-def456",
      "mitigated_at": null,
      "resolved_at": null,
      "severity": "sev2",
      "started_at": "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z",
      "status": "started",
      "summary": "The API response times have increased significantly across all endpoints.",
      "title": "API latency spike detected",
      "url": "https://app.rootly.com/incidents/abc123-def456"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z",
  "type": "rootly.onIncident"
}
```

## Create Event

The Create Event component adds a timeline event (note/annotation) to a Rootly incident.

### Use Cases

- **Investigation notes**: Add detailed investigation notes to the incident timeline

- **Cross-system sync**: Sync comments from external tools into the incident timeline

### Configuration

- **Incident ID**: The Rootly incident UUID to add the event to (required, supports expressions)
- **Event**: The note/annotation text (required, supports expressions)
- **Visibility**: Internal or external visibility (optional, default per Rootly)

### Output

Returns the created incident event with:
- **id**: Event ID
- **event**: Event content
- **visibility**: Event visibility
- **occurred_at**: Event timestamp
- **created_at**: Creation timestamp

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2026-02-10T07:34:35.902-8:00",
    "event": "Investigation update: database connections stabilized.",
