## On Issue Created

The On Issue Created trigger starts a workflow execution when a new issue is created in a Jira project.

### Use Cases

- **Issue automation**: Automate responses to new issues
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when issues are created
- **Task management**: Sync issues with external task management systems
- **Triage automation**: Automatically categorize or assign new issues

### Configuration

- **Project**: Select the Jira project to monitor
- **Issue Types**: Optionally filter by issue type (Task, Bug, Story, etc.)

### Event Data

Each issue created event includes:
- **webhookEvent**: The event type (jira:issue_created)
- **issue**: Complete issue information including key, summary, fields
- **user**: User who created the issue

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Jira webhook when configured. The webhook is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "issue": {
      "fields": {
        "creator": {
