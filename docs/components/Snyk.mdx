## On New Issue Detected

The On New Issue Detected trigger starts a workflow execution when Snyk detects new security issues in a project.

### Use Cases

- **Security alerts**: Get notified immediately when new vulnerabilities are found
- **Ticket creation**: Automatically create tickets for new security issues
- **Compliance workflows**: Trigger compliance processes when issues are detected
- **Team notifications**: Notify security teams of new findings

### Configuration

- **Project**: Optional project filter - select a project to only trigger on issues from that project
- **Severity**: Optional severity filter - select one or more severities to trigger on (low, medium, high, critical)

### Event Data

Each issue detection event includes:
- **issue**: Issue information including ID, title, severity, and description
- **project**: Project information where the issue was found
- **org**: Organization information

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Snyk webhook when configured. The webhook is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "issue": {
      "id": "SNYK-JS-12345",
      "title": "Remote Code Execution",
      "severity": "high",
      "description": "A vulnerability in the package allows remote code execution",
      "packageName": "lodash",
      "packageVersion": "4.17.20"
    },
    "project": {
      "id": "project-123",
      "name": "my-web-app"
    },
    "org": {
      "id": "org-123",
      "name": "my-org"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "type": "snyk.issue.detected"
}
```

## Ignore Issue

The Ignore Issue component ignores a specific Snyk security issue via the Snyk API.

### Use Cases

- **Risk acceptance**: Temporarily accept risks while a fix is being developed
- **False positive handling**: Suppress issues that are determined to be false positives
- **Automated suppression**: Automatically ignore issues based on predefined criteria
- **Workflow integration**: Integrate issue ignoring into broader security workflows

### Configuration

- **Project ID**: The project ID where the issue exists
- **Issue ID**: The specific issue ID to ignore
- **Reason**: The reason for ignoring the issue
- **Expires At**: Optional expiration date for the ignore rule (ISO 8601 format)

### Output

Returns information about the ignored issue including:
- **success**: Whether the operation succeeded
- **message**: Status message from the API
- **projectId**: The project ID
- **issueId**: The issue that was ignored
- **reason**: The reason provided

### Notes

- The issue will no longer appear in Snyk reports after being ignored
- Ignored issues can be unignored later through the Snyk UI or API
- Requires a Snyk plan with API access

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Issue SNYK-JS-12345 ignored successfully",
    "projectId": "project-123",
    "issueId": "SNYK-JS-12345",
    "reason": "Acceptable risk for this dependency"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "type": "snyk.issue.ignored"
}
```
