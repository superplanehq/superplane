## On Issue

The On Issue trigger starts a workflow execution when issue events occur in a GitLab project.

### Use Cases

- **Notify Slack** when an issue is created or assigned for triage
- **Create a Jira issue** when a GitLab issue is created for traceability
- **Update external dashboards** or close linked tickets when an issue is closed

### Configuration

- **Project** (required): GitLab project to monitor
- **Actions** (required): Filter by action (opened, updated, closed, reopened). Default: opened.
- **Labels** (optional): Only trigger for issues with specific labels
- **Assignees** (optional): Only trigger when issue is assigned to specific users
- **State** (optional): Only trigger for open or closed issues

### Outputs

- **Default channel**: Emits issue payload including issue IID, title, state, labels, assignees, author, and action type

Each issue event includes:
- **object_kind**: The type of event (issue)
- **event_type**: The specific event type
- **object_attributes**: Issue details including id, iid, title, description, state, action, url
- **labels**: Array of label objects at root level
- **assignees**: Array of assigned users at root level
- **project**: Project information
- **repository**: Repository information including name, url, homepage
- **user**: User who triggered the event

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a GitLab webhook when configured. The webhook is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.
