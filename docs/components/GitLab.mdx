## On Issue

The On Issue trigger starts a workflow execution when issue events occur in a GitLab project.

### Use Cases

- **Issue automation**: Automate responses to new or updated issues
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when issues are created or closed
- **Task management**: Sync issues with external task management systems
- **Label automation**: Automatically label or categorize issues based on content

### Configuration

- **Project**: Select the GitLab project to monitor
- **Actions**: Select which issue actions to trigger on: `open`, `close`, `reopen`, `update`

### Event Data

Each issue event includes:
- **object_kind**: The type of event (issue)
- **event_type**: The specific event type
- **object_attributes**: Complete issue information including title, description, state, labels
- **project**: Project information
- **user**: User who triggered the event

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a GitLab webhook when configured. The webhook is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "object_kind": "issue",
    "event_type": "issue",
    "object_attributes": {
