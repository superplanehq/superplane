## Instructions

Create an API token in Railway and paste it below.

**Important:** When creating the token, select a **specific workspace** to access its projects. The "No Workspace" option will not work.

## On Deployment Event

The On Deployment Event trigger starts a workflow when Railway sends deployment status webhooks.

### Setup

After configuring this trigger:
1. Copy the webhook URL shown in the trigger settings
2. Go to Railway → Your Project → Settings → Webhooks
3. Add the webhook URL and select "Deploy" events
4. Save the webhook configuration

### Use Cases

- **Deployment notifications**: Notify Slack when deployments complete or fail
- **Incident creation**: Create tickets when deployments crash
- **Pipeline chaining**: Trigger downstream workflows after successful deployments

### Configuration

- **Project**: Select the Railway project to monitor
- **Event Filter**: Optionally filter by deployment event type (deployed, failed, crashed, etc.)
  - Leave empty to receive all deployment events

### Event Data

Each deployment event includes:
- `type`: Event type (e.g., Deployment.deployed, Deployment.failed)
- `details.status`: Deployment status (SUCCESS, FAILED, etc.)
- `resource.deployment.id`: Deployment ID
- `resource.service`: Service name and ID
- `resource.environment`: Environment name and ID
- `resource.project`: Project information
- `timestamp`: When the event occurred

### Example Data

```json
{
  "details": {
    "branch": "main",
    "commitAuthor": "developer",
    "commitHash": "abc123def456",
    "commitMessage": "Update deployment",
    "id": "deploy-abc123",
    "serviceId": "srv-xyz789",
    "source": "GitHub",
    "status": "SUCCESS"
  },
  "resource": {
    "deployment": {
      "id": "deploy-jkl345"
    },
    "environment": {
      "id": "env-def456",
      "isEphemeral": false,
      "name": "production"
    },
    "project": {
      "id": "proj-xyz789",
      "name": "my-project"
    },
    "service": {
      "id": "srv-ghi012",
      "name": "api-server"
    },
    "workspace": {
      "id": "ws-abc123",
      "name": "My Workspace"
    }
  },
  "severity": "INFO",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "type": "Deployment.deployed"
}
```

## Trigger Deploy

The Trigger Deploy component starts a new deployment for a Railway service and waits for it to complete.

### Use Cases

- **Deploy on merge**: Automatically deploy when code is merged to main
- **Scheduled deployments**: Deploy on a schedule (e.g., nightly releases)
- **Manual approval**: Deploy after approval in the workflow
- **Cross-service orchestration**: Deploy services in sequence

### How It Works

1. Triggers a new deployment via Railway's API
2. Polls for deployment status updates (Queued → Building → Deploying → Success/Failed)
3. Routes execution based on final deployment status:
   - **Deployed channel**: Deployment succeeded
   - **Failed channel**: Deployment failed
   - **Crashed channel**: Deployment crashed

### Configuration

- **Project**: Select the Railway project
- **Service**: Select the service to deploy
- **Environment**: Select the target environment (e.g., production, staging)

### Output Channels

- **Deployed**: Emitted when deployment succeeds
- **Failed**: Emitted when deployment fails
- **Crashed**: Emitted when deployment crashes

### Example Output

```json
{
  "environment": "env-def456",
  "project": "proj-xyz789",
  "service": "srv-ghi012",
  "triggered": true
}
```
