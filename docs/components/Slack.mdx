## On App Mention

The On App Mention trigger starts a workflow execution when the Slack app is mentioned in a message.

### Use Cases

- **Slash commands**: Process commands from Slack messages
- **Bot interactions**: Create interactive Slack bots
- **Team workflows**: Trigger workflows from Slack conversations
- **Notification processing**: Process and respond to mentions

### Configuration

- **Channel**: Optional channel filter - if specified, only mentions in this channel will trigger (leave empty to listen to all channels)

### Event Data

Each mention event includes:
- **event**: Event information including message text, channel, and timestamp
- **user**: User who mentioned the app
- **channel**: Channel where the mention occurred
- **text**: The message text containing the mention

### Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Slack event subscription when configured. The subscription is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "api_app_id": "A123ABC456",
    "authed_users": [
      "U123ABC456",
      "U222222222"
    ],
    "event": {
      "channel": "C123ABC456",
      "event_ts": "1515449522000016",
      "text": "\u003c@U0LAN0Z89\u003e is it everything a river should be?",
      "ts": "1515449522.000016",
      "type": "app_mention",
      "user": "U061F7AUR"
    },
    "event_id": "Ev123ABC456",
    "event_time": 123456789,
    "team_id": "T123ABC456",

## Send and Wait for Response

The Send and Wait for Response component sends a message to a Slack channel with configurable buttons and pauses the workflow until a user clicks one of the buttons.

### Use Cases

- **Approvals**: Send approval/rejection buttons to stakeholders
- **Decision gates**: Present options and wait for user selection
- **Incident response**: Acknowledge or escalate incidents from Slack
- **Deployment confirmations**: Confirm or cancel deployments

### Configuration

- **Channel**: Select the Slack channel to send the message to
- **Message**: The message text (supports Slack markdown formatting)
- **Timeout**: Optional timeout in seconds; if no response within the timeout, the workflow continues on the "Timeout" channel
- **Buttons**: 1-4 buttons, each with a display name and a value

### Output Channels

- **Received**: Emitted when a user clicks a button; includes the button value and user info
- **Timeout**: Emitted when the timeout expires without a button click

### How It Works

1. A message with interactive buttons is posted to the configured Slack channel
2. The workflow pauses and waits for a user to click a button
3. When clicked, the message is updated to show which option was selected
4. The workflow continues on the "Received" channel with the button value

### Notes

- The Slack app must have interactivity enabled
- Only button clicks are supported as responses (no free-text)
- Each message can have 1-4 buttons

### Example Output

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "U12345678",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "team_id": "T12345678",
    "username": "john.doe"
  },
  "value": "approve"
}
```

## Send Text Message

The Send Text Message component sends a text message to a Slack channel.

### Use Cases

- **Notifications**: Send notifications about workflow events or system status
- **Alerts**: Alert teams about important events or errors
- **Updates**: Provide status updates on long-running processes
- **Team communication**: Automate team communications from workflows

### Configuration

- **Channel**: Select the Slack channel to send the message to
- **Text**: The message text to send (supports expressions and Slack markdown formatting)

### Output

Returns metadata about the sent message including channel information.

### Notes

- The Slack app must be installed and have permission to post to the selected channel
- Supports Slack markdown formatting in message text
- Messages are sent as the configured Slack bot user

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channel": "C123456",
    "text": "Hello from SuperPlane",
    "ts": "1700000000.000100",
    "user": "U123456"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
