## Create Event

The Create Event component creates a new event in Datadog.

### Use Cases

- **Deployment tracking**: Log deployment events to correlate with metrics
- **Incident annotation**: Add context to incidents with custom events
- **Workflow notifications**: Create events to track workflow execution milestones

### Outputs

The component emits an event containing:
- `id`: The unique identifier of the created event
- `title`: The event title
- `text`: The event body
- `date_happened`: Unix timestamp when the event occurred
- `alert_type`: The severity level (info, warning, error, success)
- `priority`: Event priority (normal, low)
- `tags`: Array of tags attached to the event
- `url`: Link to view the event in Datadog

### Example Output

  "data": {
    "alert_type": "info",
