Trigger workflows from Sentry issue events and update issues from workflows

## Triggers

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="On Issue Event" href="#on-issue-event" description="Start a workflow when Sentry sends issue events (created, resolved, assigned, etc.)" />
</CardGrid>

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Actions

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Update Issue" href="#update-issue" description="Update a Sentry issue (resolve, assign, ignore, etc.)" />
</CardGrid>

## Instructions

**Connection (Auth Token):** Use a **Personal Auth Token** from Sentry. Create it in **User Settings** → **Auth Tokens** → **Create New Token** with scopes: `org:read`, `project:read`, `event:write`. The token will start with `sntryu_`—paste it below.

⚠️ **Do not use the Internal Integration hex value** (e.g. `a22b2023...` or `f3233f8f...`). That is the **Client Secret**; Sentry's API returns 401 for it. Use it only in the **On Issue Event** trigger's "Webhook secret" field.

**On Issue Event trigger:** You need an Internal Integration in Sentry (Developer Settings) to get a webhook URL and the **Client Secret**. Paste the Client Secret into the trigger's "Webhook secret" field.

**For each Sentry trigger and action node:** Select your Sentry integration in the **Integration** dropdown, then click **Save** so the node is linked; otherwise you'll see "Component not configured - integration is required".

## On Issue Event

The On Issue Event trigger runs when Sentry sends webhook events for issues.

### Use Cases

- **Notify on new issues**: Send Slack/Discord messages or create Jira tickets when an issue is created
- **Resolve after deploy**: When an issue is resolved in Sentry, run follow-up steps
- **Assign or triage**: React to assigned or archived events

### Configuration

- **Events**: Choose which issue actions to listen for (created, resolved, assigned, archived, unresolved)
- **Webhook secret**: Paste the Client Secret from your Sentry Internal Integration to verify webhook signatures.

### Setup

1. In Sentry: add a webhook URL in your Internal Integration (Developer Settings → your integration → Webhooks). Use the webhook URL shown for this trigger in SuperPlane. The URL is built from WEBHOOKS_BASE_URL (set in your environment; for Docker set it in .env to your public or tunnel URL and restart the app).
2. Subscribe to **Issue** events (e.g. issue.created, issue.resolved).
3. Copy the integration's **Client Secret** into the Webhook secret field below so SuperPlane can verify webhook signatures.

**Troubleshooting:** If you see "Component not configured - integration is required", select your Sentry integration in the Integration dropdown and click Save. If connection returns 401, use a Personal Auth Token (sntryu_...) for the connection, not the Internal Integration hex value (Client Secret).

## Update Issue

The Update Issue component updates an existing Sentry issue.

### Use Cases

- **Resolve after deploy**: Resolve the issue when a fix is deployed
- **Assignment**: Assign the issue to a user or team from a workflow
- **Ignore**: Ignore or archive issues based on workflow logic

### Configuration

- **Organization**: Sentry organization slug (e.g. from trigger payload or your org name)
- **Issue ID**: The issue ID to update (e.g. from trigger: `$['On Issue Event'].issue.id`)
- **Status**: resolved, resolvedInNextRelease, unresolved, or ignored
- **Assigned To**: Actor id or username to assign the issue to

### Output

Returns the updated issue object from Sentry.
