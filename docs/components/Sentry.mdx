## Triggers

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="On Issue Event" href="#on-issue-event" description="Start a workflow when Sentry sends issue events (created, resolved, assigned, etc.)" />
</CardGrid>

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Actions

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Update Issue" href="#update-issue" description="Update a Sentry issue (resolve, assign, ignore, etc.)" />
</CardGrid>

## Instructions

Connect Sentry to SuperPlane using an Internal Integration token.

1. In Sentry: **Organization Settings** → **Developer Settings** → **New Internal Integration**
2. Name it (e.g. "SuperPlane"), then create an **Auth Token** with scopes: `org:read`, `project:read`, `event:write`
3. Paste the token below. For the **On Issue Event** trigger, configure the webhook in your Sentry integration to point to the trigger's webhook URL and subscribe to Issue events. Use the same integration's Client Secret as the webhook secret in SuperPlane when prompted.

## On Issue Event

The On Issue Event trigger runs when Sentry sends webhook events for issues.

### Use Cases

- **Notify on new issues**: Send Slack/Discord messages or create Jira tickets when an issue is created
- **Resolve after deploy**: When an issue is resolved in Sentry, run follow-up steps
- **Assign or triage**: React to assigned or archived events

### Configuration

- **Events**: Choose which issue actions to listen for (created, resolved, assigned, archived, unresolved)
- **Webhook secret**: Paste the Client Secret from your Sentry Internal Integration (used to verify webhook signatures)

### Setup

1. In Sentry: add a webhook URL in your Internal Integration (Developer Settings → your integration → Webhooks). Use the webhook URL shown for this trigger in SuperPlane.
2. Subscribe to **Issue** events (e.g. issue.created, issue.resolved).
3. Copy the integration's **Client Secret** into the Webhook secret field below.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "action": "created",
  "actor": {
    "id": "example-app",
    "name": "Example App",
    "type": "application"

  }
}
```

## Update Issue

The Update Issue component updates an existing Sentry issue.

### Use Cases

- **Resolve after deploy**: Resolve the issue when a fix is deployed
- **Assignment**: Assign the issue to a user or team from a workflow
- **Ignore**: Ignore or archive issues based on workflow logic

### Configuration

- **Organization**: Sentry organization slug (e.g. from trigger payload or your org name)
- **Issue ID**: The issue ID to update (e.g. from trigger: `$['On Issue Event'].issue.id`)
- **Status**: resolved, resolvedInNextRelease, unresolved, or ignored
- **Assigned To**: Actor id or username to assign the issue to

### Output

Returns the updated issue object from Sentry.
