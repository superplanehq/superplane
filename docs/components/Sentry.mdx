Trigger workflows from Sentry issue events and update issues from workflows

## Triggers

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="On Issue Event" href="#on-issue-event" description="Start a workflow when Sentry sends issue events (created, resolved, assigned, etc.)" />
</CardGrid>

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Actions

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Update Issue" href="#update-issue" description="Update a Sentry issue (resolve, assign, ignore, etc.)" />
</CardGrid>

## Instructions

Connect Sentry to SuperPlane using a Sentry **Personal Token**.

### API token

1. In Sentry: **Settings** → **Developer Settings** → **Personal Tokens**
2. Create a token with scopes: `org:read`, `org:write`, `project:read`, `project:write`, `event:read`, `event:write`
3. Paste the token below (tokens typically start with `sntryu_`).

### Webhook (required for triggers)

To use the **On Issue Event** trigger, you must configure a Sentry webhook to call SuperPlane:

1. Add the **On Issue Event** trigger to a canvas and save the canvas.
2. Copy the webhook URL shown in the trigger configuration sidebar.
3. In Sentry, create an **Internal Integration** and set its webhook URL to the SuperPlane webhook URL.
4. Enable **Issue** events (created/resolved/unresolved/assigned/archived).
5. Trigger an issue change in Sentry and check the trigger’s **Runs** tab.

## On Issue Event

The On Issue Event trigger runs when Sentry sends webhook events for issues.

### Use Cases

- **Notify on new issues**: Send Slack/Discord messages or create Jira tickets when an issue is created
- **Resolve after deploy**: When an issue is resolved in Sentry, run follow-up steps
- **Assign or triage**: React to assigned or archived events

### Configuration

- **Events**: Choose which issue actions to listen for (created, resolved, assigned, archived, unresolved)

### Setup

1. Add the **On Issue Event** trigger to a canvas and save the canvas.
2. Copy the webhook URL shown in the trigger configuration sidebar.
3. In Sentry, create an **Internal Integration** and set its webhook URL to the SuperPlane webhook URL.
4. Subscribe to **Issue** events (created/resolved/unresolved/assigned/archived).

## Update Issue

The Update Issue component updates an existing Sentry issue.

### Use Cases

- **Resolve after deploy**: Resolve the issue when a fix is deployed
- **Assignment**: Assign the issue to a user or team from a workflow
- **Ignore**: Ignore or archive issues based on workflow logic

### Configuration

- **Organization**: Sentry organization slug (e.g. from trigger payload or your org name)
- **Issue ID**: The issue ID to update (e.g. from trigger: `$['On Issue Event'].issue.id`)
- **Status**: resolved, resolvedInNextRelease, unresolved, or ignored
- **Assigned To**: Actor id or username to assign the issue to

### Output

Returns the updated issue object from Sentry.
