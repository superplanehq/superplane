Trigger workflows from Sentry issue events and update issues from workflows

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Triggers

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="On Issue Event" href="#on-issue-event" description="Start a workflow when Sentry sends issue events (created, resolved, assigned, etc.)" />
</CardGrid>

## Actions

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Update Issue" href="#update-issue" description="Update a Sentry issue (resolve, assign, ignore)" />
</CardGrid>

## Instructions

Connect Sentry to SuperPlane using an Internal Integration token.

1. In Sentry: **Organization Settings** → **Developer Settings** → **New Internal Integration**
2. Name it (e.g. "SuperPlane"), then create an **Auth Token** with scopes: `org:read`, `project:read`, `event:write`
3. Paste the token in the integration configuration. For the **On Issue Event** trigger, add the trigger's webhook URL in your Sentry integration (Webhooks) and subscribe to Issue events. Copy the integration's Client Secret into the Webhook secret field.

## On Issue Event

The On Issue Event trigger runs when Sentry sends webhook events for issues.

### Use Cases

- **Notify on new issues**: Send Slack/Discord messages or create Jira tickets when an issue is created
- **Resolve after deploy**: When an issue is resolved in Sentry, run follow-up steps
- **Assign or triage**: React to assigned or archived events

### Configuration

- **Events**: Choose which issue actions to listen for (created, resolved, assigned, archived, unresolved)
- **Webhook secret**: Client Secret from your Sentry Internal Integration (used to verify webhook signatures)

### Setup

1. In Sentry: add the webhook URL (shown for this trigger in SuperPlane) in your Internal Integration → Webhooks
2. Subscribe to Issue events
3. Copy the integration's Client Secret into the Webhook secret field in SuperPlane

## Update Issue

The Update Issue component updates an existing Sentry issue.

### Use Cases

- **Resolve after deploy**: Resolve the issue when a fix is deployed
- **Assignment**: Assign the issue to a user or team from a workflow
- **Ignore**: Ignore or archive issues based on workflow logic

### Configuration

- **Organization**: Sentry organization slug
- **Issue ID**: The issue ID to update (e.g. from trigger: `$['On Issue Event'].issue.id`)
- **Status**: resolved, resolvedInNextRelease, unresolved, or ignored
- **Assigned To**: Actor id or username to assign the issue to

### Output

Returns the updated issue object from Sentry.
