## Instructions

Requires a ServiceNow instance with API access. The following roles are needed on your ServiceNow instance:

**Integration account** (for Basic Auth or OAuth):
- **itil** — read/write access to the Incident table

Optionally, enable **Web Service Access Only** on the integration account to restrict it to API-only use.

**On Incident trigger**: Setting up the Business Rule on ServiceNow requires the **admin** role. This is a one-time setup.

## On Incident

The On Incident trigger starts a workflow execution when ServiceNow incident events are received via webhook.

### Use Cases

- **Incident automation**: Automate responses when incidents are created or updated
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when new incidents are created
- **Integration workflows**: Sync incidents with external systems
- **Escalation handling**: Handle incident updates automatically

### Configuration

- **Events**: Select which incident events to listen for (insert, update, delete)

### Scoping

Incident scoping (e.g. filtering by assignment group, category, or priority) is configured in the ServiceNow Business Rule conditions. This allows control over which incidents trigger the webhook.

### Required Permissions

Creating the Business Rule in ServiceNow requires the **admin** role. This is a one-time setup step.

### Business Rule Setup

This trigger provides a webhook URL and a ready-to-use Business Rule script:

1. In ServiceNow, navigate to **System Definition > Business Rules** and create a new rule
2. Set the table to `incident`, set **When** to **after**, and check **insert**, **update**, and/or **delete** as needed
3. Check **Advanced** and paste the generated script into the **Script** field
4. The script uses `sn_ws.RESTMessageV2` to send incident data to the webhook URL with the secret for authentication

### Event Data

Each incident event includes the full incident record from ServiceNow, including:
- **sys_id**: Unique identifier
- **number**: Human-readable incident number
- **short_description**: Brief summary
- **state**: Current state
- **urgency**: Urgency level
- **impact**: Impact level
- **assignment_group**: Assigned group
- **assigned_to**: Assigned user

- **Error tracking**: Automatically create incidents when errors are detected
- **Manual incident creation**: Create incidents from workflow events
- **Integration workflows**: Create incidents from external system events

### Required Permissions

The ServiceNow integration account needs:
- **itil** role — grants read/write access to the Incident table

### Configuration

- **Short Description**: A brief summary of the incident (required, supports expressions)
- **Description**: Detailed description of the incident (optional, supports expressions)
- **Urgency**: Incident urgency level (1-High, 2-Medium, 3-Low)
- **Impact**: Incident impact level (1-High, 2-Medium, 3-Low)
- **Category**: Incident category (select from list)
- **Subcategory**: Incident subcategory (depends on the selected category)
- **Assignment Group**: The group responsible for resolving the incident (select from list)
- **Assigned To**: The user assigned to resolve the incident (select from list)
- **Caller**: The user reporting the incident (select from list)

### Output

Returns the created incident object from the ServiceNow Table API, including:
- **sys_id**: Unique identifier
- **number**: Human-readable incident number (e.g. INC0010001)
- **state**: Current incident state
- **short_description**: Incident summary
- **created_on**: Creation timestamp
