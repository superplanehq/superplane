## On Branch Created

The On Branch Created trigger starts a workflow execution when a new branch is created in a GitHub repository.

### Use Cases

- **Branch automation**: Set up environments or resources for new branches
- **Branch validation**: Validate branch naming conventions
- **Notification workflows**: Notify teams when important branches are created
- **Branch processing**: Process or configure branches automatically

### Configuration

- **Repository**: Select the GitHub repository to monitor
- **Branches**: Configure which branches to listen for using predicates (e.g., equals "main", starts with "feature-")

### Event Data

Each branch event includes:
- **ref**: The branch reference (e.g., "refs/heads/feature/new-feature")
- **ref_type**: Type of reference (branch)
- **repository**: Repository information

## On Release

The On Release trigger starts a workflow execution when release events occur in a GitHub repository.

### Use Cases

- **Deployment automation**: Trigger deployments when releases are published
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications about new releases
- **Release processing**: Process release artifacts or metadata
- **Distribution workflows**: Distribute releases to multiple systems

### Configuration

- **Repository**: Select the GitHub repository to monitor
- **Actions**: Select which release actions to listen for (published, created, etc.)

### Event Data

Each release event includes:
- **action**: The action that triggered the event (published, created, etc.)
- **release**: Complete release information including tag, name, body, assets
- **repository**: Repository information
- **sender**: User who triggered the event

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a GitHub webhook when configured. The webhook is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "action": "published",
    "release": {
      "html_url": "https://github.com/acme/widgets/releases/tag/v1.2.3",
      "id": 3001,
      "name": "Release 1.2.3",
      "tag_name": "v1.2.3"
    },
    "repository": {

    "sender": {
      "html_url": "https://github.com/octocat",
      "id": 101,
      "login": "octocat"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
  "type": "github.release"
}
```

<a id="on-tag-created"></a>

## On Tag Created

The On Tag Created trigger starts a workflow execution when a new tag is created in a GitHub repository.

### Use Cases

- **Version tagging**: Trigger workflows when version tags are created
- **Release automation**: Automatically create releases from tags
- **Deployment triggers**: Deploy specific versions based on tags
- **Tag processing**: Process or validate tags as they're created

### Configuration

- **Repository**: Select the GitHub repository to monitor
- **Tags**: Configure which tags to listen for using predicates (e.g., equals "v*", starts with "release-")

### Event Data

Each tag event includes:
- **ref**: The tag reference (e.g., "refs/tags/v1.0.0")
- **ref_type**: Type of reference (tag)
- **repository**: Repository information
- **sender**: User who created the tag

### Webhook Setup

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "description": "Example repository for webhook payloads",
    "master_branch": "main",
    "pusher_type": "user",
    "ref": "v1.2.3",

- **Post-processing**: Process artifacts or results after workflow completion

### Configuration

- **Status reporting**: Update commit status from external systems
- **Deployment tracking**: Mark commits as deployed or failed
- **Quality gates**: Report code quality check results

### Configuration

- **Repository**: Select the GitHub repository
- **Commit SHA**: The full 40-character commit SHA (supports expressions)
- **State**: Status state - pending, success, failure, or error
- **Context**: A label to identify this status check (e.g., "ci/build", "deploy/production")
- **Description**: Short description of the status (max ~140 characters, optional)
- **Target URL**: Link to build logs, test results, or deployment details (optional)

### Output

Returns the created status object with all status information.

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "context": "ci/build",
    "created_at": "2026-01-16T17:45:00Z",
    "description": "All checks passed",
    "state": "success",
    "target_url": "https://ci.example.com/builds/123",
    "updated_at": "2026-01-16T17:45:10Z"

## Run Workflow

The Run Workflow component triggers a GitHub Actions workflow and waits for it to complete.

### Use Cases

- **CI/CD orchestration**: Trigger builds and deployments from SuperPlane workflows
- **Automated testing**: Run test suites as part of workflow automation
- **Multi-stage pipelines**: Coordinate complex deployment pipelines
- **Workflow chaining**: Chain multiple GitHub Actions workflows together

### How It Works

1. Dispatches the specified GitHub Actions workflow with optional inputs
2. Waits for the workflow run to complete (monitored via webhook and polling)
3. Routes execution based on workflow conclusion:
   - **Passed channel**: Workflow completed successfully
   - **Failed channel**: Workflow failed or was cancelled

### Configuration

- **Repository**: Select the GitHub repository containing the workflow
- **Workflow File**: Path to the workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Branch or Tag**: Git reference to run the workflow on (default: main)
- **Inputs**: Optional workflow inputs as key-value pairs (supports expressions)

### Output Channels

- **Passed**: Emitted when workflow completes successfully
- **Failed**: Emitted when workflow fails or is cancelled

### Notes

- The component automatically sets up webhook monitoring for workflow completion
- Falls back to polling if webhook doesn't arrive
- Can be cancelled, which will cancel the running GitHub Actions workflow

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "workflow_run": {
      "conclusion": "success",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/acme/widgets/actions/runs/9001",
      "id": 9001,
      "status": "completed"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-16T17:56:16.680755501Z",
  "type": "github.workflow.finished"
}
```
