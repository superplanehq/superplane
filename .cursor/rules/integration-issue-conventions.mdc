# SuperPlane Integration Issue Conventions

Apply these conventions whenever creating or editing integration base issues or component (trigger/action) issues for SuperPlane.

## Template format: IMPORTANT block at top

Every issue body must start with the appropriate IMPORTANT block (then a blank line, then the rest of the content).

**Base issues** — use this block at the very top:

```markdown
> 🚨 **IMPORTANT (critical)**
>
> This content has **not** passed detailed review yet.
> Review and rethink the suggested connection method before implementing.
> If unsure, reach out on **Discord** first.
```

**Component issues (triggers and actions)** — use this block at the very top:

```markdown
> 🚨 **IMPORTANT (critical)**
>
> This content has **not** passed detailed review yet.
> Review and rethink configuration options and output channels before implementing.
> If unsure, reach out on **Discord** first.
```

For child issues, the parent reference line (`**Parent (base integration):** #N`) comes **after** this block, then the rest of the content.

## Hierarchy and ordering

- **Base issue first**: One base integration issue per tool (e.g. `[GitHub] Base`). All component issues (triggers and actions) are children of that base.
- **Child issues**: One issue per component. Each child must include `**Parent (base integration):** #BASE_ISSUE_NUMBER` (replace with the actual base issue number) immediately after the IMPORTANT block (see Template format above).

## Title format

- **Base**: `[{Integration Name}] Base` (e.g. `[GitHub] Base`, `[ArgoCD] Base`).
- **Actions**: `[{Integration Name}] {Operation Name}` in Title Case (e.g. `[GitHub] Get Issue`, `[Slack] Archive Channel`).
- **Triggers**: `[{Integration Name}] On {Event}` in Title Case (e.g. `[GitHub] On Deployment`, `[GitHub] On Pull Request`).

## Configuration: Triggers vs Actions

- **Actions** (execute operations): Configuration fields must be **execution parameters** — what resource to operate on, how to perform the operation, what data to send. Not filters.
- **Triggers** (listen for events): Configuration fields must be **filters** — what events to listen for, what values to match (repository, status, labels). Not execution parameters.

Example: A trigger `[ArgoCD] On Sync Completed` should have config like "Application Filter", "Sync Status", not "Revision" or "Prune" (those belong to the Sync action).

## Output channels

- **Triggers**: Use a single **default** channel (events are emitted; outcomes determined downstream).
- **Actions**: It depends on what the component does and whether the user would want to model different paths in the workflow.
  - **Multiple channels** when the action produces a result that should branch: e.g. `success` / `failed`, or `clear` / `degraded` / `critical` (e.g. listIssues by highest urgency), or `approved` / `rejected`.
  - **Single default channel** when there is one logical outcome stream, or when "success" varies by user (e.g. HTTP status 200 vs 201 vs 404 might all be valid). Do not force success/failure channels on every action.

## Use cases and descriptions

- **Description**: 1–2 sentences explaining **what the component does to external systems**, not just that it exists. Avoid "Enable X to Y as part of SuperPlane workflows."
- **Use cases**: 2–3 **specific, realistic scenarios** (e.g. "Send Slack notification when production deployment pipeline completes"). Avoid generic patterns like "Automate {operation} within a CI/CD workflow."

## When creating issues on GitHub

- Create the **base issue first**, then create **one child issue per component**.
- Put `**Parent (base integration):** #BASE_ISSUE_NUMBER` immediately after the IMPORTANT block in each child issue body.
- Attach child issues as **sub-issues** of the base. Create issues **sequentially** to avoid API rate limiting.
