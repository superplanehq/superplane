# SuperPlane Issue Logger Conventions

Apply these conventions when creating or editing issue drafts in `tmp/pm_logger` for general SuperPlane issues (non-integration).

## Issue types

- **bug**: Something isn't working as expected (incorrect behavior, failure, regression).
- **enhancement**: Small/medium improvement to an existing feature already in the app.
- **feature**: Completely new feature or functionality.
- **papercut**: Small issue, bug, or inconsistency; minor improvement that doesn't break flows.

Bug vs papercut: breaks a flow or blocks usage → bug. Annoying but workable → papercut.

## Title and body

- **Title**: Short — **max 40 characters**. One or two concrete concepts; not a full list of details, not too vague. Stored in the file as `### Title` (or clear header) so the log-to-GitHub step can reuse it.
- **Body**: Use the per-type template from the issue-logger skill (bug, papercut, enhancement, feature). Keep drafts short and efficient; no empty sections. **Do not put Priority in the body** — Priority is set only via the Board Project field when logging to GitHub.
- **Priority**: Always suggested (P1–P4) and confirmed with the user before writing the draft and before logging to GitHub; store only in memory or Board, never in the draft body.

## When creating issues on GitHub

- **Never log the issue until the user has verified the draft** (title, body, type, priority) and explicitly approved (e.g. "looks good", "log it").
- Create issues **sequentially** to avoid API rate limiting.
- Use one type label per issue: `bug`, `enhancement`, `feature`, or `papercut` (match repo labels).
- Add to SuperPlane Board (project 2) and set Priority via Board fields. Do not set Integration Status for general issues.
